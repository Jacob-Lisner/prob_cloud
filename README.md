# prob_cloud
 
This repository contains files and methods demonstrating a custom non-parametric probility distribution developer that attempts to directly learn probability density clouds. The method was initially developed to analyze data collected from the UN in an attempt to predict national suicide rates based on national statistics. The method has similar accuaracy and AOC values to the next best tested method (decision trees). This repository contains files sufficient for demonstrating the results and is best seen via analysis_demonstration.py.
